## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Execution Policy (Windows Users Only) Optional

If you are a Windows user and encounter an error related to the execution policy (e.g., `set-executionpolicy`), follow these steps to allow your CLI tool to run scripts:

### üìù Steps:

1. **Open PowerShell**:
   - Right-click on the Start menu and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.

2. **Check Current Execution Policy**:
   - Before changing the policy, you can check the current setting by running:
   
     ```powershell
     Get-ExecutionPolicy
     ```

3. **Set Execution Policy**:
   - Run the following command to set the execution policy to `RemoteSigned`:
   
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
     ```

4. **Confirm the Change**:
   - When prompted, type `Y` and press **Enter**.

5. **Verify the Policy**:
   - To verify the change, you can run:
   
     ```powershell
     Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser
     ```

   It should now display `RemoteSigned`.

6. **Close PowerShell**:
   - After making the change, close the PowerShell window.

7. **Run Your CLI**:
   - Now, you should be able to run the CLI command without any issues.

### ‚ùì Why is this Required?

Windows has a built-in security feature that prevents running scripts from untrusted sources. By changing the execution policy to `RemoteSigned`, you are allowing scripts that are downloaded from the internet to run, provided they are signed by a trusted publisher. This ensures a balance between security and usability.

---

With these steps completed, you can continue using the CLI tool on Windows without any execution policy errors!
